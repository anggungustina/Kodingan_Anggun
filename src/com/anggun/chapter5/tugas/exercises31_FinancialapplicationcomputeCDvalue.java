/*(Financial application: compute CD value) Suppose you put $10,000 into a CD
with an annual percentage yield of 5.75%. After one month, the CD is worth
10000 + 10000 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10047.92
 After two months, the CD is worth
10047.91 + 10047.91 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10096.06
 After three months, the CD is worth
10096.06 + 10096.06 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10144.44
 and so on.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount (e.g., 10000), the
annual percentage yield (e.g., 5.75), and the number of months (e.g., 18) and
displays a table as presented in the sample run.
Enter the initial deposit amount: 10000
Enter annual percentage yield: 5.75
Enter maturity period (number of months): 18
Month CD Value
1 10047.92
2 10096.06
...
17 10846.57
18 10898.54
