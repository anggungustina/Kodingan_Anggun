/*(Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month
into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%. Thus, the monthly interest rate is 0.05 / 12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the
account becomes
100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
 After the second month, the value in the account becomes
(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
 After the third month, the value in the account becomes
(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
 and so on.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount (e.g., 100), the annual interest rate (e.g., 5), and the number of months (e.g., 6) then displays the
amount in the savings account after the given month.
